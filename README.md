# FirstGame

This is the first game I've ever created by using C# scripts in Unity. I created this game by following the book: [Learning C# by Developing Games with Unity 2020 - Fifth Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/learning-c-by-developing-games-with-unity-2020-fifth-edition/9781800207806). <br> <br>
Although the book is meant for C# beginners and included a large amount of C# knowledge I already knew, it was still incredible useful for learning Unity and how to integrate C# scripts.
